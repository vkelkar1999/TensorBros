Our project is a Vaccine tracker and calculator for the state of California.
We gather information from the user regarding to health and occupation and following the standards laid out by the California department of health,
we predict what phase an individual belongs in and an estimated date that they will be eligible for the vaccine.

If they are already eligible, we ask for their zip code to provide them with the closest public vaccination spots.

Deployed in Google Cloud and Firebase, we are using Tensorflow to build our prediction model and developing the front-end in react.
